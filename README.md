# Next.js Sample Application

## Overview

This repository contains a sample Next.js application that demonstrates how to use the framework for building web applications. It includes a basic stack
for development of full-stack applications(Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma ORM, Better Auth, and more).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It is highly recommended to use the [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime instead of Node.js while using this template.

## Usage

1. Create a clone of this repository or use it as a template.
2. Install the dependencies via `bun install`.
3. Start the development server with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d && bun run dev`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When running any of the `bunx` commands, make sure to use the `--bun` flag to ensure that the environment variables are set correctly.
